It takes multiple regex/extractor pairs to try in sequence.\n * Extractors can take a \"cursor\" representing the offset in the match to look at. This makes it easy to combine extractors.\n * combineExtractors() does the work of combining them, keeping track of the cursor through multiple extractions.\n * Some extractions are super dumb and simpleParse and fromStrings help DRY them.\n */\n\nfunction combineRegexes() {\n  for (var _len = arguments.length, regexes = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n    regexes[_key] = arguments[_key];\n  }\n\n  var full = regexes.reduce(function (f, r) {\n    return f + r.source;\n  }, '');\n  return RegExp('^' + full + '$');\n}\n\nfunction combineExtractors() {\n  for (var _len2 = arguments.length, extractors = Array(_len2), _key2 = 0; _key2 < _len2; _key2++) {\n    extractors[_key2] = arguments[_key2];\n  }\n\n  return function (m) {\n    return extractors.reduce(function (_ref, ex) {\n      var mergedVals = _ref[0],\n          mergedZone = _ref[1],\n          cursor = _ref[2];\n\n      var _ex = ex(m, cursor),\n          val = _ex[0],\n          zone = _ex[1],\n          next = _ex[2];\n\n      return [Object.assign(mergedVals, val), mergedZone || zone, next];\n    }, [{}, null, 1]).slice(0, 2);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction parse(s) {\n  if (s == null) {\n    return [null, null];\n  }\n\n  for (var _len3 = arguments.length, patterns = Array(_len3 > 1 ? _len3 - 1 : 0), _key3 = 1; _key3 < _len3; _key3++) {\n    patterns[_key3 - 1] = arguments[_key3];\n  }\n\n  for (var _iterator = patterns, _isArray = Array.isArray(_iterator), _i = 0, _iterator = _isArray ? _iterator : _iterator[Symbol.iterator]();;) {\n    var _ref3;\n\n    if (_isArray) {\n      if (_i >= _iterator.length) break;\n      _ref3 = _iterator[_i++];\n    } else {\n      _i = _iterator.next();\n      if (_i.done) break;\n      _ref3 = _i.value;\n    }\n\n    var _ref2 = _ref3;\n    var regex = _ref2[0];\n    var extractor = _ref2[1];\n\n    var m = regex.exec(s);\n    if (m) {\n      return extractor(m);\n    }\n  }\n  return [null, null];\n}\n\nfunction simpleParse() {\n  for (var _len4 = arguments.length, keys = Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n    keys[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n  }\n\n  return function (match, cursor) {\n    var ret = {};\n    var i = void 0;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n      ret[keys[i]] = parseInt(match[cursor + i]);\n    }\n    return [ret, null, cursor + i];\n  };\n}\n\n// ISO and SQL parsing\nvar offsetRegex = /(?:(Z)|([+-]\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d))?)/,\n    isoTimeBaseRegex = /(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?:[.,](\\d{1,9}))?)?)?/,\n    isoTimeRegex = RegExp('' + isoTimeBaseRegex.source + offsetRegex.source + '?'),\n    isoTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp('(?:T' + isoTimeRegex.source + ')?'),\n    isoYmdRegex = /([+-]\\d{6}|\\d{4})(?:-?(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d\\d))?)?/,\n    isoWeekRegex = /(\\d{4})-?W(\\d\\d)-?(\\d)/,\n    isoOrdinalRegex = /(\\d{4})-?(\\d{3})/,\n    extractISOWeekData = simpleParse('weekYear', 'weekNumber', 'weekDay'),\n    extractISOOrdinalData = simpleParse('year', 'ordinal'),\n    sqlYmdRegex = /(\\d{4})-(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)/,\n    // dumbed-down version of the ISO one\nsqlTimeRegex = RegExp(isoTimeBaseRegex.source + ' ?(?:' + offsetRegex.source + '|([a-zA-Z_]{1,256}/[a-zA-Z_]{1,256}))?'),\n    sqlTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp('(?: ' + sqlTimeRegex.source + ')?');\n\nfunction extractISOYmd(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    year: parseInt(match[cursor]),\n    month: parseInt(match[cursor + 1]) || 1,\n    day: parseInt(match[cursor + 2]) || 1\n  };\n\n  return [item, null, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOTime(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    hour: parseInt(match[cursor]) || 0,\n    minute: parseInt(match[cursor + 1]) || 0,\n    second: parseInt(match[cursor + 2]) || 0,\n    millisecond: parseMillis(match[cursor + 3])\n  };\n\n  return [item, null, cursor + 4];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOOffset(match, cursor) {\n  var local = !match[cursor] && !match[cursor + 1],\n      fullOffset = signedOffset(match[cursor + 1], match[cursor + 2]),\n      zone = local ? null : FixedOffsetZone.instance(fullOffset);\n  return [{}, zone, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractIANAZone(match, cursor) {\n  var zone = match[cursor] ? new IANAZone(match[cursor]) : null;\n  return [{}, zone, cursor + 1];\n}\n\n// ISO duration parsing\n\nvar isoDuration = /^P(?:(?:(\\d{1,9})Y)?(?:(\\d{1,9})M)?(?:(\\d{1,9})D)?(?:T(?:(\\d{1,9})H)?(?:(\\d{1,9})M)?(?:(\\d{1,9})(?:[.,](\\d{1,9}))?S)?)?|(\\d{1,9})W)$/;\n\nfunction extractISODuration(match) {\n  var yearStr = match[1],\n      monthStr = match[2],\n      dayStr = match[3],\n      hourStr = match[4],\n      minuteStr = match[5],\n      secondStr = match[6],\n      millisecondsStr = match[7],\n      weekStr = match[8];\n\n\n  return [{\n    years: parseInt(yearStr),\n    months: parseInt(monthStr),\n    weeks: parseInt(weekStr),\n    days: parseInt(dayStr),\n    hours: parseInt(hourStr),\n    minutes: parseInt(minuteStr),\n    seconds: parseInt(secondStr),\n    milliseconds: parseMillis(millisecondsStr)\n  }];\n}\n\n// These are a little braindead.

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link valueOf} and {@link toJSDate}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\n\nvar DateTime = function () {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  function DateTime(config) {\n    classCallCheck(this, DateTime);\n\n    var zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone,\n        invalidReason = config.invalidReason || (Number.isNaN(config.ts) ?

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `entering`\n *  - `entered`\n *  - `exiting`\n *  - `exited`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info).
